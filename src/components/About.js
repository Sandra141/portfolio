                    Hi, I am Sandra MÃ¼ller. I studied at the University of Business and Society in Ludwigshafen for four interesting and challenging semesters and was able to gain many insights into the diverse Japanese culture. Since then, I have fallen in love with programming. <br /><br />
                    But why web development? I started working with HTML and CSS while I was still at school. At the time, I was writing my seminar paper and had trouble organising my sources, so I created a simple but structured website. <br /><br />
                    The final trigger for my passion, however, was my working student job in a small company, where I got to know the work of a web developer, which is why I took part in a bootcamp shortly afterwards and why programming now won't let me go.
                </p>
