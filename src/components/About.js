                <p>
                    I am Sandra MÃ¼ller. I dropped out of my interesting and challenging studies at the University of Applied Sciences in Ludwigshafen because I was able to gain many insights into the diverse Japanese culture there. Since then, I have fallen in love with programming. <br /><br />
                    So why web development? I started working with HTML and CSS while I was still at school. At the time, I was writing my seminar paper and had trouble organising my sources, so I created a simple but structured website. <br /><br />
                    The final trigger for my passion, however, was my working student job in a small company, where I got to know the work of a web developer, which is why I took part in a bootcamp shortly afterwards and why programming now won't let me go.
